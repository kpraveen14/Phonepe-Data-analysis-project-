## 📊 Project Overview

A full-stack data analytics project analyzing PhonePe’s digital payments ecosystem using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. This repository contains the complete workflow including data preparation, cleaning, modeling, visualization, and insights generation.

This project explores the growth, usage patterns, and transactional behavior within the PhonePe digital payments platform. The dataset is processed using Python and Excel, transformed using SQL, and finally visualized in Power BI. The dashboard highlights transaction volume, regional adoption, merchant categories, and user behavior trends to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Workflow

1. Excel – Initial data cleaning, formatting, and merging of data files.

2. Python (Pandas) – Deep cleaning, handling missing values, data transformation, and feature creation.

3. SQL – Uploading cleaned data into MySQL, running analytical queries, generating aggregated tables.

4. Power BI – Building interactive dashboards with DAX measures, drill-throughs, and slicers.

5. Insights – Interpreting patterns related to transaction frequency, geographical usage, and category-level performance.

## 📈 Key Insights & Visuals
Key Insights Identified
- Digital transactions show strong month-on-month growth, especially in Tier 1 & Tier 2 cities.

- UPI payments dominate, contributing major volume in both P2P and P2M segments.

- Certain states (e.g., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh) show highest transaction density.

- Merchant categories like recharge, utilities, and retail payments are rapidly expanding.

- Peak transaction times cluster around evenings and weekends, indicating user behavior patterns.

Power BI Visuals Include:

- Transaction Volume Trend (Line Chart)

- State-wise Usage Heatmap

- Category-wise Payment Breakdown

- Top Cities by Transaction Value

- Monthly Growth KPIs

- Filters for Region, Category, and Transaction Mode

- Drill-through pages for city-level details
